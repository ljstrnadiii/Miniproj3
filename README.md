# Miniproj3
only need `analysis.r` and `Mini3.R` files 

### `analysis.r`:
- calls all the methods in the `Mini3.R` file to perform AIC, BIC, and CV on 
  Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Partial Least Squares Regression, and 
  Principal Component Regression. 

### `Mini3.R`:
- Class of functions. import by calling `source("Mini3.R")` in interpretter or
  in file like analysis.R


### Collaboration:
- Check for errors. 
1. I am not sure if pls and pcr for BIC should be a linear relationship. 
2. make sure that the functions are returning the actual models and minimums
3. discuss questions that pertain to the project:
  a. which models and procedures make sense?
  b. why?
